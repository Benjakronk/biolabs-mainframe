# Confidential Memorandum
## Re: Project Chimera Funding Extension

To: Board of Directors, Apex Corporation
From: Dr. Lyra Vex, Chief Research Officer
Date: [Redacted]

Esteemed Board Members,

I write to formally request an extension of funding for Project Chimera, which has yielded unprecedented results in Pokémon enhancement and Conduit integration. Our recent breakthroughs necessitate an expansion of our research scope.

Key Achievements:
1. Successful multi-stage evolution of Specimen H-173 (see attached report).
2. Integration of multiple elemental affinities in a single Pokémon.
3. Development of Psionic Amplification Chambers (PACs) for enhanced cognitive abilities.
4. Promising results in Conduit-Pokémon neural synchronization trials.

Funding Requirements:
- ₽500 million for facility expansion, including construction of additional PACs.
- ₽300 million for acquisition of rare elemental catalysts.
- ₽200 million for enhanced security measures and containment protocols.
- ₽100 million for staff expansion and specialized training.

Potential Applications:
1. Military: Enhanced Pokémon-Conduit units for special operations.
2. Economic: Patentable processes for accelerated Pokémon evolution.
3. Medical: Regenerative therapies derived from Specimen H-173's cellular structure.
4. Energy: Harnessing multi-elemental affinities for sustainable power generation.

Risks and Mitigation:
We acknowledge the ethical concerns raised by the Ethics Committee. However, the potential benefits far outweigh the risks. We have implemented stringent containment protocols and loyalty programming to ensure control over enhanced specimens.

I firmly believe that Project Chimera represents the future of Pokémon research and human-Pokémon integration. Your continued support will ensure Apex Corporation remains at the forefront of this revolutionary field.

Respectfully,
Dr. Lyra Vex
