# Project Chimera: Conduit Combat Efficiency Report

**Security Level: Ultra Violet**
**Project Lead: Dr. K. Nexus**

## Test Parameters

- **Location**: Facility Omega, Subterranean Arena B
- **Duration**: 120 minutes
- **Subjects**: 4 Conduits (C-7, C-12, C-15, C-19), 1 Enhanced Specimen (H-173E)
- **Objective**: Evaluate combat effectiveness of Conduits against Enhanced Specimen H-173E

## Conduit Profiles

1. **C-7**: Electric/Steel affinity, 5 years experience
2. **C-12**: Fire/Fighting affinity, 3 years experience
3. **C-15**: Water/Ice affinity, 7 years experience
4. **C-19**: Psychic/Fairy affinity, 2 years experience

## Enhanced Specimen Profile

**H-173E**: Evolved form of Hydling, multiple elemental affinities, suspected psionic abilities

## Combat Sequence

| Time (min) | Event | Outcome |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Engagement initiated | All Conduits operational |
| 15 | C-12 launches Fire Blast | H-173E counters with Hydro Pump from secondary head |
| 27 | C-15 attempts Ice Beam | H-173E shifts to Fire affinity, melts incoming attack |
| 38 | C-7 and C-19 coordinate Thunderbolt and Psychic | H-173E momentarily stunned |
| 42 | H-173E emits unidentified psionic pulse | C-19 incapacitated, others disoriented |
| 57 | C-7 deploys Steel-type barrier | H-173E breaches with multi-elemental assault |
| 73 | C-12 and C-15 attempt pincer maneuver | H-173E utilizes previously unseen Dragon-type ability |
| 88 | C-7 launches final assault | H-173E demonstrates extreme regenerative capabilities |
| 95 | H-173E corners remaining Conduits | Test terminated by safety protocol Delta |

## Results

- **Conduit Casualties**: 0 (All subjects retrieved with non-fatal injuries)
- **H-173E Status**: Undamaged, displayed 47% estimated power output
- **Collateral Damage**: 78% of arena facilities destroyed

## Key Observations

1. H-173E demonstrated ability to rapidly switch between at least 6 elemental types.
2. Psionic abilities of H-173E exceeded all projections, suggesting potential for further development.
3. Regenerative factor of H-173E renders conventional damage-based combat strategies ineffective.
4. Coordinated Conduit attacks showed limited effectiveness, but were ultimately insufficient.

## Recommendations

1. Immediate upgrade of all Conduit training protocols to include multi-elemental threat scenarios.
2. Further research into psionic dampening technology is critical.
3. Explore potential for replication of H-173E's regenerative capabilities in future Conduit enhancements.
4. Consider H-173E for [REDACTED] initiative, pending approval from Project Overseer.
