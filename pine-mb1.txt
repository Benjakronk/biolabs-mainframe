Subject: Potential Discovery
MB,
The research team returned with intriguing information about the Vespair Lair. Based on their description, it may be what we've been searching for all this time. I'm working on getting more details without raising suspicion. I may put in a request for more Larvasp to send a new team of trainers to investigate.

MB,
A breakthrough. One of the trainers we've sent on a mission on behalf of Biolabs showed me the Star Orb found on the Vespair Lair site today. They seem unaware of its true significance. They're now leaving on a mission to explore the ruins near Gladium Arena. I'll keep tabs on their findings.

MB,
The group is once again heading out to investigate the tree. I've arranged to accompany them under the guise of scientific interest. This is our chance to confirm if it's truly the artifact we need. Will report back soon.
