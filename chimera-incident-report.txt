# Security Incident Report
## Facility Omega - Containment Breach

Date: [Redacted]
Report Filed By: Chief of Security, Marcus Steele

Incident Overview:
At 0247 hours, a Level 5 containment breach occurred in Sector 7 of Facility Omega. Enhanced Specimen H-173E escaped primary containment, resulting in significant damage to the facility and multiple casualties.

Chronology of Events:
- 0247: Psionic dampeners in Sector 7 experienced unexplained failure.
- 0249: H-173E breached containment cell, overpowering guard detail.
- 0251: Facility-wide alarm triggered. Lockdown protocols initiated.
- 0255: H-173E encountered Conduit response team in Corridor B. Three Conduits incapacitated.
- 0301: Specimen last seen entering ventilation system in Sector 4.
- 0310: All non-essential personnel evacuated. Sweep teams deployed.
- 0452: Facility declared clear. H-173E's whereabouts unknown.

Casualties and Damages:
- Personnel: 7 injured (3 critical), 2 fatalities
- Structural Damage: Estimated at 65% of Sector 7, 30% of Sector 4
- Equipment Loss: 2 Psionic Amplification Chambers destroyed

Containment Measures Taken:
1. Facility-wide psionic dampening field activated (radius: 5km)
2. All nearby settlements placed on high alert
3. Covert reconnaissance teams deployed to surrounding areas
4. Cover story disseminated: industrial accident at research facility

Preliminary Findings:
1. H-173E displayed abilities beyond projected parameters
2. Standard containment protocols proved inadequate
3. Possible insider involvement in psionic dampener failure (under investigation)

Recommendations:
1. Immediate upgrade of all containment systems
2. Review and enhancement of Conduit combat training against psionic threats
3. Implementation of Project Cerberus as failsafe (pending approval)
4. Expansion of memory alteration protocols for all staff below Level 4 clearance

Note: This incident underscores the volatility of Project Chimera. Reassessment of risk-reward ratio strongly advised.
