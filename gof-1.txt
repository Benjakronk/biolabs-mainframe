# Project GoF (Gain of Function): Research Summary

Classification: Top Secret
Lead Researchers: Dr. Sira Vartian, Dr. Sylas Ito

Project Overview:
Project GoF aims to create an enhanced Pok√©mon hybrid by splicing the DNA of Prayblade (specimen PB-027) with Veerum (specimen VR-104). The goal is to combine Prayblade's predatory instincts and physical prowess with Veerum's adaptability and disease resistance.

Key Objectives:
1. Enhance overall physical capabilities (strength, speed, endurance)
2. Improve disease resistance and adaptive immune response
3. Maintain or enhance Prayblade's hunting instincts
4. Incorporate Veerum's shape-shifting abilities to a limited degree

Methodology:
1. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to splice key genetic sequences
2. Viral vector delivery system for gene integration
3. Embryonic stem cell manipulation for hybrid embryo creation
4. Artificial incubation in controlled environment

Progress to Date:
- Successfully isolated key genetic markers from both species
- Achieved 67% viability in preliminary hybrid embryos
- Observed unexpected synergies in immune system development
- Encountered challenges in stabilizing shape-shifting abilities

Key Findings:
1. Hybrid specimens show a 200% increase in physical strength compared to Prayblade
2. Disease resistance surpasses both parent species by an order of magnitude
3. Unexpected development of highly aggressive behavior in adolescent specimens
4. Limited success in incorporating shape-shifting; hybrid can alter skin texture and color

Concerns:
1. Heightened aggression may make specimens difficult to control
2. Potential for creating a superior predator that could disrupt ecosystems
3. Unforeseen mutations occurring in later generations of hybrids
4. Ethical considerations of creating a potentially sentient hybrid species

Next Steps:
1. Refine gene splicing technique to better incorporate shape-shifting abilities
2. Develop advanced containment protocols for mature specimens
3. Initiate long-term studies on hybrid specimen lifespan and reproductive capabilities
4. Explore potential military applications as per request from [REDACTED]
