Subject: Project Proteus - Weekly Update
Dr. Singh,
I hope this email finds you well. Please provide an update on the cellular stability of our shape-shifting subject. Have we made any progress in extending the duration of its transformations?
Also, ensure all staff are adhering to our strict nomenclature guidelines. We cannot risk any leaks about the true nature of our subject.

Subject: New Security Protocols
Team,
Due to the sensitive nature of Project Proteus, we're implementing new security measures:

All notes must be digitized and encrypted by end of day.
No discussion of the project outside of the secure lab area.
Our subject will now be referred to as "P-1" in all documentation.

Compliance is mandatory. Any breaches will result in immediate removal from the project.

Subject: Genetic Sequencing Results
Dr. Zhang,
Your latest report on P-1's genetic sequencing is fascinating. The ability to reorganize its cellular structure at will is truly remarkable.
I'm particularly interested in your hypothesis about replicating specific genetic markers. If we could isolate this ability, the applications would be groundbreaking.
Let's schedule a meeting to discuss further testing protocols.

Subject: Breakthrough and Next Steps
Team,
Exciting news! P-1 has successfully maintained a transformed state for over 24 hours. This is a significant milestone for Project Proteus.
Next steps:

Run a full battery of tests on P-1 in its current state.
Attempt to induce a return to its original form.
Analyze any genetic drift that may have occurred.

Remember, absolute discretion is crucial. Our work here could revolutionize our understanding of Pok√©mon genetics.
