Dr. Vex,

I'm writing to express my growing concerns about Specimen H-173E. During today's cognitive assessment, it displayed an unprecedented level of problem-solving ability. It completed the maze in record time, then proceeded to rearrange the blocks to spell out "RELEASE" in perfect Unown script.

More alarmingly, I've been experiencing severe migraines and vivid dreams since beginning work with H-173E. I can't shake the feeling that it's trying to communicate with me somehow.

I strongly recommend we increase psionic shielding around its containment area and consider suspending direct interaction tests until we better understand its capabilities.

Regards,
Dr. Chen

Dr. Chen,

Your concerns are noted, but I assure you they're unfounded. The specimen's behavior is simply a sign that our enhancement procedures are working better than anticipated. This is cause for celebration, not alarm.

As for your migraines and dreams, I suggest you visit the medical bay for a check-up. We can't allow personal discomfort to impede our progress. Remember, we're on the cusp of a breakthrough that will change the world of Pokémon research forever.

Increase the psionic shielding if it makes you feel better, but the tests will continue as scheduled.

Chief Research Officer

Chen,

I overheard your conversation with Vex in the lab today. You're right to be worried about H-173E. I've been monitoring its brainwave patterns, and they're off the charts. It's not just intelligent; I think it's developing some kind of collective consciousness across its multiple heads.

We need to be careful. Vex is so focused on results that she's ignoring the risks. I've started keeping a separate, encrypted log of my observations. If things go south, we may need evidence to protect ourselves.

Watch your back, and let me know if you notice anything else unusual.

Dear Team,

I'm thrilled to announce that Project Chimera has entered its final phase. Our work with Specimen H-173E has exceeded all expectations, and we're on the brink of a revolutionary breakthrough in Pokémon evolution and human-Pokémon synchronization.

Effective immediately, all staff are required to undergo daily psionic screening. This is merely a precaution to ensure our minds are protected as we work with increasingly powerful psychic emanations.

Additionally, please note that all personal electronic devices are now prohibited in the research areas. Any urgent communications must go through my office first.

Let's make history together!

Dr. Vex,

As per your request, we've been monitoring staff communications. We've detected several encrypted messages being sent from Dr. Nakamura's terminal. While we haven't cracked the encryption yet, the frequency and timing of these messages are suspicious.

Additionally, Dr. Chen has been accessing restricted files related to Pokémon League regulations and whistleblower protections.

How would you like us to proceed?

Marcus Steele
Chief of Security

Steele,

Keep a close eye on both of them. If they attempt to leave the facility or contact anyone outside, detain them immediately. We're too close to let a few squeamish scientists ruin everything.

Prepare to initiate Protocol Omega if necessary. And remember, this conversation never happened.

Vex
