# The Prophecy of the Many-Minded Serpent

*Translated from ancient Shiman runes, discovered in the submerged ruins of the Coral Citadel*

In the depths where light fears to tread,
A creature stirs, many thoughts in one head.
From humble beginnings, a single mind grows,
As heads multiply, its power flows.

First comes the Hydling, small and meek,
In warm waters, its future it seeks.
One mind, one voice, but potential untold,
In its cells, a secret of healing old.

Next rises Pluraling, thoughts start to divide,
Multiple voices, in one form reside.
Each head a gateway to realms unseen,
In dreams and visions, its power gleaned.

Plurorm emerges, six minds entwined,
Each mastering elements of a different kind.
Fire and water, grass and lightning's spark,
Ice and venom, each leaving its mark.

Plurydra ascends, its power unfurled,
Eight minds united, to shape the world.
Wisdom of ages, in each eye it gleams,
Bridging the gap 'tween reality and dreams.

But hark! The prophecy speaks of one more,
Plurofera, the form that none saw before.
Eighteen minds merged, a cosmic design,
All types as one, in form serpentine.

Beware, ye seekers of power and might,
For the Many-Minded Serpent's full sight,
Spans time and space, past and future as one,
Its judgment swift, once its wrath is begun.

Yet hope remains for those pure of heart,
Who seek not dominion, but wisdom's art.
For the Serpent's power, terrible and grand,
May yet be the key to unite sea and land.
