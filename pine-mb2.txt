Subject: Operation Debrief
Dr. Pine,
Your recent success in acquiring the data is commendable. However, I'm curious about the methods you employed. Our intelligence suggests that security protocols were bypassed with unusual ease.
Did you perhaps utilize some of your... specialized resources from Project Proteus?
Remember, while we appreciate initiative, using unauthorized assets could compromise both our operation and your position.

Amelia,
We've detected some anomalies in the security footage from the night of the operation. There are discrepancies in the movement patterns of your team.
If you've used P-1 or any of its derivatives, we need to know immediately. The implications could be far-reaching and potentially destabilize our entire plan.
Await my call for a secure debriefing.

Subject: Urgent - Containment Protocol
Dr. Pine,
Our worst fears may be realized. There's evidence of unauthorized genetic material at the breach site. If P-1 was indeed used and has not fully returned to its original state, we face a significant security risk.
Initiate containment protocol immediately. Ensure all traces are eliminated.
Your dedication to our cause is appreciated, but this level of risk was not sanctioned. We'll discuss the consequences once the situation is under control.
