Classification: Ultra Violet

Subject Overview:
Our research focuses on a remarkable Pokémon species with unparalleled morphological plasticity. This creature, henceforth referred to as "Subject P," demonstrates an extraordinary ability to reconfigure its cellular structure at will.

Key Observations:

1. Cellular Mimicry:
   - Subject P can replicate the appearance and basic abilities of any Pokémon it observes.
   - Transformation process takes approximately 2.7 seconds on average.
   - Mimicked forms are nearly indistinguishable from the original, barring minor imperfections (e.g., eye color remains constant).

2. Genetic Flexibility:
   - Subject P's DNA exhibits unprecedented malleability.
   - Can temporarily adopt genetic markers of mimicked species.
   - Original genetic sequence reasserts itself after transformation ends.

3. Memory Retention:
   - Subject P appears to retain a "catalog" of previously mimicked forms.
   - Transformation speed increases for previously adopted forms.
   - Unclear if there's a limit to the number of forms it can remember.

4. Limitations:
   - Cannot replicate complex abilities or moves requiring specific organ structures.
   - Strength level in mimicked form correlates with Subject P's base power, not the mimicked Pokémon's.
   - Sustained transformations (>24 hours) appear to cause stress to Subject P.

Potential Applications:

1. Espionage and Reconnaissance:
   - Infiltration of wild Pokémon populations for ecological studies.
   - Potential for covert human-settlement infiltration by mimicking domesticated Pokémon.

2. Genetic Research:
   - Study of Subject P's malleable genome could revolutionize our understanding of Pokémon evolution.
   - Possible applications in treating genetic disorders in both Pokémon and humans.

3. Conservation Efforts:
   - Replication of rare or extinct Pokémon for breeding programs.
   - Note: Ethical concerns raised; further discussion needed.

4. Training and Therapy:
   - Use in Pokémon psychology studies to understand inter-species interactions.
   - Potential application in therapy for traumatized Pokémon by mimicking non-threatening forms.

Security Protocols:
- Subject P must be kept in a specialized containment unit when not undergoing testing.
- All staff interacting with Subject P must undergo daily identity verification.
- No personal Pokémon allowed in the research facility to prevent unauthorized mimicry.

Ethical Considerations:
The unique abilities of Subject P raise significant ethical questions. While the potential benefits are enormous, we must carefully consider the implications of exploiting a sentient being's abilities for our purposes. A full ethics review is scheduled for next month.

Future Directions:
1. Investigate the limits of Subject P's genetic memory.
2. Explore potential for mimicking inanimate objects.
3. Study the psychological effects of prolonged shapeshifting on Subject P.
4. Analyze the energy requirements for transformation process.
