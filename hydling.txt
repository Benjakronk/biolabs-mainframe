# Confidential Research Report: Hydling
## Libra University: Pokémon Research Institute, Starhaven Branch

**Subject**: Hydling
**Classification**: Dragon-type, Larval Stage
**Research Lead**: Dr. Mira Scales

### Physical Description:
Hydling presents as a small, serpentine creature with an average length of 30cm. Its body is covered in soft, reddish scales that harden slightly with age. Notable is the presence of small, underdeveloped additional head buds along its neck, typically numbering two to three.

### Habitat:
Primarily aquatic, Hydling nests are found in secluded, warm water bodies. Interesting to note is their preference for nesting sites near geothermal activity.

### Behavior:
Hydling exhibits a peculiar feeding behavior. Newly hatched specimens have been observed consuming remnants of their egg shells, which are rich in minerals essential for their growth. This behavior persists for approximately 72 hours post-hatching.

### Sensory Capabilities:
- **Vision**: Limited. Hydling possesses rudimentary eyes capable of detecting movement and light changes within a 30ft radius.
- **Other Senses**: Highly developed electroreception, possibly compensating for limited vision. Can detect bioelectric fields within a 40ft radius underwater.

### Special Abilities:
1. **Rapid Cellular Regeneration**: Hydling demonstrates an extraordinary ability to regrow damaged tissue. Preliminary tests show a complete regrowth of a severed tail tip within 48 hours.

2. **Thermal Regulation**: Despite its small size, Hydling can maintain a body temperature of 38°C even in cooler waters, suggesting an efficient internal heating mechanism.

### Evolutionary Observations:
The presence of additional head buds indicates the potential for multiple heads in its evolved forms. We hypothesize that these buds become fully formed heads during the evolution process, possibly triggered by specific environmental stimuli or stress factors.

### Potential Applications:
The rapid cellular regeneration observed in Hydling could have significant medical applications. Further research is recommended to isolate the genes responsible for this trait.

### Cautions:
While generally docile, Hydling can deliver a surprisingly potent bite if threatened. Handlers are advised to wear protective gloves when interacting with specimens.

### Further Research Needed:
1. Long-term study of head bud development
2. Analysis of the composition of Hydling egg shells
3. Investigation into the potential psychic abilities hinted at in ancient texts referring to its evolved forms
