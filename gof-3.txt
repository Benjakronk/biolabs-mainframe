Vistrix,

I understand your concerns about the escalating situation in Aridune. Rest assured, we at Starhaven Biolabs are doing everything in our power to support the efforts to maintain stability in the region.

Regarding your inquiry about our "special assets," I can confirm that the latest batch has been prepared and is ready for deployment. These assets have been specifically tailored to withstand the harsh desert environment and should prove highly effective in neutralizing the rebel factions.

Key points to note:

1. The assets demonstrate enhanced endurance and can operate for extended periods without sustenance.
2. They possess advanced camouflage abilities, making them ideal for covert operations in the desert terrain.
3. Their heightened aggression has been carefully balanced with loyalty conditioning to ensure optimal performance and control.

However, I must stress the importance of discretion. These assets are highly classified, and their existence must remain strictly confidential. Any leak could have severe repercussions for both our organizations.

On a related note, we've made significant progress in refining the control mechanisms. The latest neural implants have shown a 98% success rate in field tests. This should address your previous concerns about potential "independent action."

Lastly, I must remind you that once deployed, these assets have a limited operational lifespan. Please ensure your team is prepared for proper containment and disposal protocols post-operation.

If you need any further information or have additional requests, please don't hesitate to contact me through our secure channel.

Best regards,
Dr. Alexis Ribo
Director, Starhaven Biolabs

Dr. Ribo,

Your prompt response is appreciated. The League Council is pleased to hear that the assets are ready for deployment. Your team's efficiency in adapting them to the Aridune environment is commendable.

I've forwarded the specifications to our operations team. They're particularly interested in the camouflage abilities you mentioned. If these perform as well as you suggest, we may finally be able to put an end to the insurgency that has been plaguing the region.

Regarding the control mechanisms, the 98% success rate is reassuring. However, we cannot afford any margin of error. What failsafes are in place for the remaining 2%? The Council is particularly concerned about potential civilian exposure or ecological impact if an asset were to go rogue.

On the matter of discretion, I assure you that only a select few within the League are aware of this operation. We've attributed the recent "disturbances" in Aridune to natural Pokémon behavioral changes due to climate shifts. This cover story has been widely accepted by the public.

One last thing - there have been rumors of a group of trainers investigating unusual Pokémon activities in the region. While they likely pose no real threat, we should be prepared to misdirect their efforts if necessary.

Keep me informed of any further developments. The success of this operation is crucial for maintaining the delicate balance of power in our region.

Regards,
Vistrix
