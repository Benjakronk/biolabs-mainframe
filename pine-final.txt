Subject: CRITICAL - Aftermath Protocol
Team,
By now, you're aware of the explosion at the facility. I must stress: THIS WAS NOT OUR DOING. We have an unknown actor working against us, possibly against Biolabs itself. Stay vigilant.
URGENT PRIORITY: Several hybrids were released during the chaos. These specimens are CRITICAL to our mission. They must be retrieved at all costs. Remember, these hybrids are the smoking gun - irrefutable evidence of the Pok√©mon League's corruption and unethical practices.
Your primary objectives:

Locate and secure any escaped hybrids.
Gather any remaining data on Project Chimera and GoF.
Maintain your cover at all costs.

The situation is volatile. Trust no one outside our immediate circle. If confronted, you know nothing of our true purpose.
This will be my last communication for the foreseeable future. I'm initiating deep cover protocol. Continue with our predetermined plan. You all know your roles.
Remember why we fight. The future of our region depends on exposing the truth.
Our cause is just.
A.P.
P.S. If you can access my area on the server, I have a lot of the stolen project data saved there. Purge all communications after memorizing critical information.
