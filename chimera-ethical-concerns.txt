# Internal Memo: Ethical Concerns Regarding Project Chimera

From: Dr. Elias Morrow, Head of Ethics Committee
To: Dr. Lyra Vex, Chief Research Officer
CC: Apex Corporation Board of Directors

Dr. Vex,

I am compelled to formally document the Ethics Committee's grave concerns regarding Project Chimera. While we acknowledge the scientific merit of your work, several aspects of the project violate fundamental ethical principles of Pokémon research and human experimentation.

Primary Concerns:

1. Pokémon Welfare:
   - Forced evolution processes cause undue stress and potential long-term harm.
   - Multi-elemental integration may lead to psychological instability in specimens.

2. Conduit Safety:
   - Neural synchronization trials pose unacceptable risks to human subjects.
   - Long-term effects of Psionic Amplification Chambers are unknown and potentially devastating.

3. Ecological Impact:
   - Creation of unnaturally enhanced Pokémon could disrupt ecological balance if specimens escape.
   - Acquisition of rare elemental catalysts may harm endangered Pokémon populations.

4. Ethical Boundaries:
   - The project's military applications blur the line between Pokémon partnership and weaponization.
   - "Loyalty programming" raises serious questions about free will and Pokémon rights.

5. Public Safety:
   - Enhanced specimens like H-173E pose a significant threat if containment fails.
   - Potential for technology misuse if it falls into the wrong hands.

Recommendations:

1. Immediate suspension of all forced evolution procedures.
2. Independent review of all Conduit-related experiments by external experts.
3. Implementation of a comprehensive ecological impact assessment.
4. Development of an exit strategy for humane treatment of existing enhanced specimens.
5. Full disclosure to relevant authorities regarding the scope and nature of Project Chimera.

Dr. Vex, I urge you to consider these concerns seriously. The path you're treading is dangerous, not just for the subjects of your experiments, but for the very fabric of our society's relationship with Pokémon.

The Ethics Committee is prepared to escalate this matter if our concerns are not adequately addressed.

Regards,
Dr. Elias Morrow
