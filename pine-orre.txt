Subject: Project Umbra Update
Greetings,
Our mutual friend suggested I reach out regarding Project Umbra. How goes the door-closing process? Our team is eager to replicate your results with the test subjects here.
Any insights on handling the occasional "open heart"?
Regards,
A.P.

A.P.,
Progress continues. The key is persistence in the face of resistance. Some doors are stubborn, but none are unbreakable.
For "open hearts," we've found success with continuous application of the XD series protocols. Remember, complete closure is the goal.

Subject: Acquisition Query
S.R.,
Your last transmission was most illuminating. We're particularly interested in your early-stage acquisition methods. Our current approach feels... inefficient.
Also, any advice on handling overly curious local professors? We have a Yucca that needs pruning.

For acquisitions, we've found success with the Snag approach. It's direct and leaves little trace. I'll send details through our secure drop.
As for curious types, consider a redirect. A vivid distraction in one direction can obscure much in another. If that fails, more permanent solutions may be necessary.
Remember, shadows work best in total darkness.

S.R.,
The pieces are falling into place. Our mutual friend will be pleased with the progress on both fronts.
When can we expect the arrival of the "special consultant" we discussed? Our facility is prepared for a discreet visit.
The dawn of a new day approaches.

The consultant, codenamed "E", will arrive in a month. Prepare your most secure location. His insights on the project will be crucial for your next phase. Mind you, Ignas will accompany him; he is a bit... aggressive.
Remember, in our world, light is the enemy. Embrace the shadow.
