# Confidential: Psychological Evaluation of Conduit Subjects
## Project Chimera - Mental Health Assessment

Evaluator: Dr. Evelyn Marsh, Chief Psychologist
Date: [Redacted]

Subject Overview:
This report summarizes the psychological states of Conduits involved in Project Chimera, with a focus on those who have undergone neural synchronization trials with enhanced Pokémon specimens.

Key Findings:

1. Conduit C-7 (Electric/Steel affinity):
   - Exhibits increased paranoia and electrosensitivity
   - Reports vivid dreams of "metal forests" and "living lightning"
   - Demonstrates improved reflexes but decreased emotional regulation

2. Conduit C-12 (Fire/Fighting affinity):
   - Displays heightened aggression and difficulty controlling body temperature
   - Experiences frequent flashbacks to combat scenarios with H-173E
   - Shows signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

3. Conduit C-15 (Water/Ice affinity):
   - Manifests ability to lower body temperature beyond normal human limits
   - Reports feeling "disconnected" from own body, possible dissociative symptoms
   - Demonstrates enhanced cognitive abilities but struggles with social interactions

4. Conduit C-19 (Psychic/Fairy affinity):
   - Exhibits signs of telepathic abilities, unconfirmed but under investigation
   - Experiences severe migraines and occasional loss of consciousness
   - Shows significant personality changes, including increased empathy and decreased self-preservation instincts

Common Themes:
- All subjects report feeling a "lingering presence" in their minds post-synchronization
- Increased type affinity often correlates with decreased psychological stability
- Subjects demonstrate difficulty distinguishing between their own memories and those potentially acquired from Pokémon

Recommendations:
1. Implement mandatory daily psychological evaluations for all Conduit subjects
2. Develop specialized therapy protocols to address unique mental health challenges
3. Consider temporary suspension of neural synchronization trials pending further investigation
4. Explore potential for Psychic-type Pokémon assistance in mental stabilization

Ethical Concerns:
The long-term psychological effects of these experiments remain unknown. There is a significant risk of permanent mental alteration or damage to Conduit subjects. The ethics of continuing these trials must be carefully weighed against potential benefits.
