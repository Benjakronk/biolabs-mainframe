Subject: URGENT - Mission Compromise
MB and Orre team,
I cannot stress enough how FURIOUS I am about the recent operation. The foot soldiers under E's command nearly KILLED our targets! Ignas even did kill someone! This reckless behavior has potentially made unnecessary enemies and risked exposing our entire operation.
Need I remind you that these trainers are valuable assets we've been trying to cultivate? This ham-fisted approach could also undo months of careful intelligence gathering.
I demand an explanation and assurance that this will NOT happen again.

Dr. Pine,
While I understand your frustration, I must remind you that we achieved our primary objective. The spear has been retrieved, which was the mission's core purpose. Our secondary objective of finding the orb was not acccomplished.
That said, I agree that the level of force was excessive. However, you must realize that in our line of work, violence is sometimes a necessary evil. We can't always operate in the shadows.
As for Ignas, he's a valuable asset but admittedly difficult to control. His methods are extreme but often effective. We'll address this issue internally.
Remember, Dr. Pine, we're not just playing scientist anymore. This is a war, and casualties are inevitable.

Dr. Pine and MB,
We apologize for any complications arising from E's actions. And Ignas can indeed be... overzealous in his approach. We'll make sure to brief him more thoroughly on the delicate nature of Shima operations in the future.
Rest assured, we value our partnership and will take steps to ensure smoother collaboration going forward. Perhaps a joint strategy session to align our methodologies would be beneficial.
